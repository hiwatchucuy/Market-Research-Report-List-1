<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Pozzolans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Raw Pozzolan</li><li>Calcined Pozzolan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural pozzolans market is categorized into two primary types: raw pozzolan and calcined pozzolan. Raw pozzolan, sourced naturally from volcanic ash or clay deposits, is utilized for its reactive properties that enhance cement performance when blended. Calcined pozzolan, on the other hand, involves heating raw pozzolan to elevated temperatures, transforming its chemical structure to increase reactivity, making it suitable for high-performance concrete applications. Both types contribute to sustainable construction practices by reducing reliance on traditional cement.</p></p>
