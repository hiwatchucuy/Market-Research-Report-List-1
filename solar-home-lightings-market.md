<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lightings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar home lighting market consists of two primary types: off-grid solar and grid-tied solar systems. Off-grid solar systems operate independently, using solar panels and battery storage to provide electricity without relying on the traditional power grid, catering to remote or underserved areas. In contrast, grid-tied solar systems are connected to the main power grid, allowing homeowners to generate their own electricity while also drawing from the grid when needed, often benefiting from net metering and reduced energy bills.</p></p>
