<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antibody Fragments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>F(ab) Fragment</li><li>F(ab’)2 Fragment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antibody fragments market includes two primary types: F(ab) fragments and F(ab’)(2) fragments. F(ab) fragments consist of the antigen-binding region of antibodies, allowing for high specificity and minimal immune response, making them suitable for targeted therapies and diagnostics. In contrast, F(ab’)(2) fragments are formed by dimerizing two F(ab) fragments through disulfide bonds, providing enhanced valency for increased binding affinity. These fragments are increasingly used in therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer treatment and immunoassays.</p></p>
